The most common source of plastic that can be recycled and reshaped with a heat gun is polyethylene (PE). This is a type of plastic that is widely used in a variety of products, including plastic bags, food packaging, and plastic bottles.

To recycle polyethylene plastic, it is first collected and sorted by type. The plastic is then cleaned and melted down using heat. The melted plastic is then molded into new products using a process called injection molding.

Using a heat gun, it is possible to reshape polyethylene plastic by heating it until it becomes pliable. This can be useful for repairing or altering plastic objects, such as toys or household items. It is important to use caution when working with a heat gun, as the high temperatures involved can be dangerous if not handled properly.

There are other types of plastic that can be recycled and reshaped with a heat gun, such as polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). However, polyethylene is the most common type of plastic that is recycled in this way.
