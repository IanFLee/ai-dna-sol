Sushi-grade fish is safe to eat raw because it is specially prepared to minimize the risk of foodborne illness. Here are some of the steps that are typically taken to ensure the safety of raw fish used in sushi:

    Selection: The first step in preparing safe sushi is to choose high-quality, fresh fish that has been handled properly from the time it was caught. Sushi-grade fish should be caught using methods that minimize the risk of contamination, such as using clean fishing gear and handling the fish carefully.

    Processing: The next step is to process the fish properly. This typically involves gutting and filleting the fish as soon as possible after it is caught, and then storing it at appropriate temperatures to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.

    Freezing: Some types of sushi-grade fish, such as tuna and salmon, are frozen to kill parasites that may be present in the flesh. This process, known as "flash freezing," involves freezing the fish to extremely low temperatures (-35 to -40 degrees Celsius) for a period of time (at least 15 hours for tuna and at least 7 days for salmon).

    Thawing: Sushi-grade fish should be thawed slowly and carefully, to prevent the growth of bacteria. This typically involves thawing the fish in the refrigerator, rather than at room temperature or in warm water.

Overall, the safety of raw fish used in sushi depends on careful handling and preparation throughout the entire process, from the time it is caught until it is served. As long as these precautions are taken, sushi-grade fish can be safely eaten raw.
