Sushi-grade fish is safe to eat raw because it is specially prepared to minimize the risk of foodborne illness. Here are some of the steps that are typically taken to ensure the safety of raw fish used in sushi:

    Selection: The first step in preparing safe sushi is to choose high-quality, fresh fish that has been handled properly from the time it was caught. Sushi-grade fish should be caught using methods that minimize the risk of contamination, such as using clean fishing gear and handling the fish carefully.

    Processing: The next step is to process the fish properly. This typically involves gutting and filleting the fish as soon as possible after it is caught, and then storing it at appropriate temperatures to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.

    Freezing: Some types of sushi-grade fish, such as tuna and salmon, are frozen to kill parasites that may be present in the flesh. This process, known as "flash freezing," involves freezing the fish to extremely low temperatures (-35 to -40 degrees Celsius) for a period of time (at least 15 hours for tuna and at least 7 days for salmon).

    Thawing: Sushi-grade fish should be thawed slowly and carefully, to prevent the growth of bacteria. This typically involves thawing the fish in the refrigerator, rather than at room temperature or in warm water.

Overall, the safety of raw fish used in sushi depends on careful handling and preparation throughout the entire process, from the time it is caught until it is served. As long as these precautions are taken, sushi-grade fish can be safely eaten raw.

There are a few methods that can be used to kill parasites and bacteria in raw fish without cooking it or freezing it. One option is to treat the fish with heat using a process called "sashimi zuke." This involves marinating the raw fish in a mixture of soy sauce and sake (a type of Japanese rice wine) for a period of time, typically at least a few hours and up to a few days. The acidity of the soy sauce and the alcohol in the sake help to kill any parasites or bacteria that may be present in the fish.

Another option is to treat the fish with a solution of salt or vinegar. Soaking the fish in a saltwater solution or vinegar can help to kill any parasites or bacteria that may be present. This method is more effective for smaller fish, as it may not be as effective for larger, thicker cuts of fish.

It is important to note that these methods may not be completely effective at killing all parasites and bacteria, and there is still a risk of foodborne illness if the fish is not handled and stored properly. If you are uncertain about the safety of eating raw fish, it is best to err on the side of caution and cook it before consuming it.
