UBUNTU TERMINAL

To download the audio from a YouTube video using youtube-dl from the Ubuntu terminal, you will need to have youtube-dl installed on your system. You can install youtube-dl using the following command:

sudo apt-get install youtube-dl

Once youtube-dl is installed, you can use the following command to download the audio from a YouTube video:

youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

This will download the audio from the specified YouTube video and save it as an MP3 file in the current directory.

You can specify the download location and file name using the -o option. For example:

youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 -o '/path/to/downloads/%(title)s.%(ext)s' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

This will download the audio file to the specified location, using the title of the video as the file name and the appropriate file extension (e.g. ".mp3").

IN PYTHON


To download the audio from a YouTube video using Python, you will need to use a third-party library such as youtube-dl. youtube-dl is a command-line utility that allows you to download videos from YouTube and other video-sharing websites.

Here is an example Python script that demonstrates how to download the audio from a YouTube video using youtube-dl:

import subprocess

# Set the URL of the YouTube video that you want to download
video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

# Use youtube-dl to download the video as an audio file
subprocess.run(["youtube-dl", video_url, "--extract-audio", "--audio-format", "mp3"])

This script uses the subprocess module to call the youtube-dl command with the appropriate arguments. The --extract-audio option tells youtube-dl to extract the audio from the video and save it as a separate file. The --audio-format option specifies the desired audio format, in this case MP3.

Note that you will need to have youtube-dl installed on your system in order for this script to work. You can install youtube-dl using pip:

pip install youtube-dl

You can also specify the download location and file name using the -o option. For example:

subprocess.run(["youtube-dl", video_url, "--extract-audio", "--audio-format", "mp3", "-o", "C:\Downloads\%(title)s.%(ext)s"])

This will download the audio file to the specified location, using the title of the video as the file name and the appropriate file extension (e.g. ".mp3").

You can find a list of available options for youtube-dl by running the youtube-dl --help command.
