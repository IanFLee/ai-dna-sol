Sashimi zuke is a Japanese dish that involves marinating thinly sliced raw fish in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. The process of making sashimi zuke involves the following steps:

    Select a high-quality, fresh piece of fish. Common types of fish used for sashimi zuke include tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.

    Slice the fish into thin, even slices using a sharp knife. The thickness of the slices will depend on the type of fish you are using.

    In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to create the marinade. The proportions of these ingredients will depend on your personal taste, but a common ratio is 1:1:1 (1 part soy sauce, 1 part mirin, 1 part sugar).

    Place the sliced fish in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Use a spoon or spatula to gently coat the fish with the marinade.

    Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 30 minutes to 1 hour to allow the fish to marinate. The longer you marinate the fish, the more flavorful it will be.

    When the marinating time is up, remove the fish from the refrigerator and use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer the slices to a clean plate. Discard the marinade.

    Serve the sashimi zuke immediately, garnished with finely sliced scallions or green onions if desired.
