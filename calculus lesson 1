Lesson 1: Introduction to Calculus

    Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change and motion. It is concerned with the rates at which quantities change and with the accumulation of those changes over time.

    There are two main branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus is concerned with rates of change and slopes of curves, while integral calculus is concerned with the accumulation of quantities and the area under and between curves.

    The fundamental concept in calculus is the derivative, which is a measure of how a function is changing at a particular point. The derivative can be thought of as the slope of the function at that point, and it is represented by the symbol "d/dx" (pronounced "dee-dee-ex").

    The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation. Differentiation is a fundamental tool in calculus that is used to model and analyze many real-world phenomena, such as the motion of objects and the spread of diseases.

    The other fundamental concept in calculus is the integral, which is a measure of the accumulation of quantities over a given interval. The integral is represented by the symbol "âˆ«" (pronounced "sigma"), and the process of finding the integral of a function is called integration.
