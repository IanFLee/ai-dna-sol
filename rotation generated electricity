Electricity is generated through the use of generators, which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. In a generator, the mechanical energy is typically provided by a rotating shaft, which is turned by some external force such as a steam turbine, a wind turbine, or a hydroelectric turbine.

Inside the generator, there is a coil of wire called the armature, which is suspended between the poles of a magnet. As the shaft rotates, it causes the armature to spin within the magnetic field. This causes the electrons in the wire to flow in a specific direction, creating an electric current. The magnitude of the current depends on the strength of the magnetic field, the speed at which the armature is spinning, and the number of turns in the armature coil.

The generated electric current is then transmitted to a transformer, which increases or decreases the voltage of the current to a level suitable for transmission over power lines. The transformed current is then distributed to homes and businesses through a network of power lines.

In this way, the rotation of a shaft can be converted into electricity through the use of a generator. The specific details of the generator design and the method used to provide the mechanical energy will depend on the particular application and the type of electricity being generated.
