There are several methods that can be used to produce rubbing alcohol, but the most common method involves the fermentation and distillation of grains or other organic materials.

Here is a general outline of the process for producing rubbing alcohol:

    Grains or other organic materials are mixed with water to create a mash.
    The mash is fermented by adding yeast, which converts the sugars in the mash into ethanol through the process of fermentation.
    The fermented mash is then distilled to purify the ethanol and remove impurities.
    The purified ethanol is combined with a denaturant, such as acetone or denatonium benzoate, to make it unfit for consumption.
    The resulting mixture is filtered and bottled as rubbing alcohol.

The exact process for producing rubbing alcohol may vary depending on the specific type of alcohol being used and the desired end product.
